"1. Problem Statement  
 
1. Hypothesis 1: There exists a correlation between change in loan in intraday file and change in New 
Loan value. Higher the change and better the correlation 
2. Hypothesis 2:A combined dataset of Intraday and previous day EOD dataset can help us in 
identifying the changes and patterns in New Loan. 
 
2. Dataset 
Datasets used in the study are Securities Finance datasets. They are Intraday, NewLoan, EndofDay (EOD) 
datasets respectively.New Loan data is fetched by using APIs provided by SF and rest data is available in 
form of flat files. 
Universe: US equity stocks that are part of the Securities Finance end of day Intraday file.  
Time Period: The study is focused on the period between 1stJul 2021 – 30th Jun 2022.  
Our predictions for New Loan were based on the most recent Securities Finance Intraday file available 
on that business day. 
 
3. Methodology  
As we are having two problem statements. 
1. Identifyingsignificant change in Security Finance New Loan dataset using Intraday dataset for US 
Equities. 
 
2. Based on the Securities Finance Intraday and Previous day EOD dataset, we are identifying 
significant change in the Securities Finance New Loan dataset for US equities. 
 
Since any significant changes in the former will be reflected in the latter. 
Intraday dataset is available 28 hours prior to the publication of the EOD files. This means that with the 
proposed hypothesis, change in New Loan can be captured at least one day in advance in case of 
hypothesis 2. For hypothesis 1, since the dataset involved is only Intraday it means that the change in 
New Loan can be deduced along with Intraday. So, the business value of this study helps in clients 
possessing the information pertaining new loan very early change 
Classification:  
For the both the problem statements we are performing classification for identifying change in new 
loan. We are using 10% as threshold for which we will be getting how much changeis there in new loan. 
We are using Decision Tree Classifier to train the model for both the problem statements. This classifier is having tree-like structure, where inner nodes are the features of the data, branches 
show the decision rules, and each leaf node of the tree serves as the result. Decision nodes are used to 
make any decision and have multiple branches, whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions 
and do not contain any further branches. 
So, we can also say that a decision tree classifier is a graphical way of obtaining all possible solutions to a 
particular problem based on given conditions. As the size of the tree increases means tree becomes 
deeper, and more typical decision rules and models will fit more accurately. 
Sometimes decision tree leads to overfitting, so in order to avoid overfitting we used a hyperparameter 
called min_impurity_decreases. This parameter helps to avoid overfitting in decision tree as it prevents 
tree from doing further split. 
Regression:  
After performing classification regression is applied on the problem statement 2 i.e., taking Intraday and 
previous day EOD data only for Quantity and then predicting the New Loan Quantity. 
We first normalize the data using “Min-Max Scaler” data pre-processing technique then apply Linear 
Regression Algorithm on normalized data for predicting the value of new loan quantity.  
Linear regression is a statistical technique that shows a linear relationship between a dependent 
variable (y) and an independent variable (X). Using linear regression, we can find how the value of the 
dependent variable changes as the value of the independent variable changes.And this is what we are 
doing i.e., how much New Loan data changes as the value of Intraday and previous day EOD data 
changes.  
We used Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate prediction error rates and model performance. MAE 
refers to the magnitude of difference between prediction of an observation and true value of that 
observation.  
 
4. Learning & Challenges  
Learning:  
We learnt how to fetch the data using APIs, analysis of data based on different aspects like regions and 
markets. Frequency of datasetis different as Intraday data is of present day and EOD data is of previous 
day so to establishing relationship in between them is good learning task for us. 
We learnt about different terminologies like finance market, Intraday, New Loan, EOD, etc. 
Challenges:  
We faced difficulties in collecting and fetching the huge datafor one year, merging multiple files, and 
finding which features are impacting more on the new loan. 
All the data is not present in single file, like some data is fetched through APIs and some data is present 
in different files so merging that data in one single file is quite a typical task. Terminologies such as Intraday, New Loan, EOD, Value on Loan, Qu
are new to us.

The above two figures represent the graph between actual new loan quantity and predicted new loan 
quantity for 1 and 1.5 years of Intraday and previous day EOD data after applying linear regression 
model. Blue color line shows predicted values and red lines shows actual values for New Loan Quantity. 
Figures 4 to 9 shows the comparison of actual new loan quantity with predicted values for three 
different indices for 1 and 1.5 years respectively. 
 
6. Future Work  
Classification: Instead of classifying New Loan into two labels i.e., >=10% and <10%, we can even 
increase the number of labels to classify the New Loan like for four labels we can categories new loan 
value as decrease, no significant change, increase, very high increase and accordingly we can fix our 
threshold for which we are getting equal values for all four classes. 
After classifying new loan, we can make individual models for each label to find out the exact magnitude 
in the new loan. 
Regression: Based on the market capital and indices, we can make different clusters of the data and 
then we can apply multiple regression models on each cluster. We can then analyze the results of 
different clusters individually.   "
